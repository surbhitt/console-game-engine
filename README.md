# Introduction 

A game engine written in C++. More like a wrapper that facilitates the usage of the command line as a buffer to render graphics using characters(just like pixels).

e.g. Cellular Automata another project of mine very near to my heart used the CMDGameEngine for graphics [CellularAutomataLink](https://github.com/surbhitt/cellular-automata).


[NOTE]

The code was written on a windows machine with the target as windows, compiled using the MSVC build tools. In the process of porting to gcc and making the code linux compatible.
